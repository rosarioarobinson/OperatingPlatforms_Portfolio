# Operating Platforms Portfolio for CS 230
The included document focuses on my interpretation and ability in working through a design of a software application while communicating the specifications and requirements to a client and/or team. 

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
    
The Gaming Room was a client that created a game called Draw It or Lose It. Draw It or Lose It is essentially a game that is loosely based on the 1980s television game *Win, Lose, or Draw*. The application provided by The Game Room renders images from a large library of stock images to guess or solve a puzzle.
    
This game was only available as an Android application and wished for it to be expanded to multiple operating platforms. Aside from being available on multiple platforms (including mobile devices), they had to ensure the main server chosen could handle high-definition images, have one or more teams involved, and have unique IDs for each game and team.
    
**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
    
While developing this documentation, I believe that I worked through the domain model and recommendation sections the best. The domain model asked for a UML diagram that displays how The Gaming Room's app would be created in a program. In this section, I was detailed and was able to display through the diagram what exactly would be needed to properly code this section. The recommendation section asked what recommendations I would have for The Gaming Room based on multiple aspects such as the operating platform, operating systems architectures, and so forth. I was as detailed as possible in this section to ensure that The Gaming Room would fully understand and consider my recommendations.
    
**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
    
Since I have never used a design document like this before, I did find it hard to adjust to. However, throughout the weeks once I became adjusted to it, the domain model, in particular, helped the most while developing the code. Having a visual of what each section represents, such as the program driver, singleton tester, and other classes that are inherited makes it easier to create the code and to the specifications that The Gaming Room desires.
    
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
    
If I had to choose a section to revise, I would choose the evaluation section. I found this section to be the denser with information and the toughest to fully understand what is required of each operating platform. The one thing I forgot to include, however, is what browsers would be best and compatible with each platform is not included.
    
**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
    
I interpreted the user's needs first by breaking down the software requirements given by The Gaming Room, then from there, I focused on each section of the software design document to properly provide information for the client. Keeping the user in mind while designing was important to consider to ensure that I am following what the client's wishes are, and not misinterpreting what requirements the client would need. Carefully reading through the client's needs, requirements, and constraints allows me to ensure I am programming the application to what the client wishes.
    
**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
    
I approached designing software gradually and went through the process of trying to understand some of the main requirements and sections required. It took a while to get adjusted to, as I have never fully designed something in this manner before. However, specific techniques such as utilizing UML diagrams and studying information based on each operating platform will greatly help me in the future when dealing with other applications with other companies.
